This is a game of 20 Questions using facts about dragons to guess the one you're thinking of! This project implements a binary tree structure and forms it by reading an XML file with the questions and answers. There is a restricted game version where you can play only using the questions and answers read in from the XML file, and an unrestricted game version where if the game guesses wrong you can add a differentiating question and dragon answer to the game!

I got most of my dragon info from the following websites:
